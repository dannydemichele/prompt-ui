- *Hook:* Here are five of the most spiritually healing places that you can go to.
- Nature is an obvious answer, but there are some places in nature that are better than others.

- At number five, we have large parks and botanical gardens. [footage of 
  - Unlike forests, the beautiful thing about parks is that you can be at peace knowing you probably won't get attacked by a wild animal.

- Number four: mountains. [footage from the top of a mountain]
  - The feeling of successfully hiking a mountain is one of the best feelings in the world.
  - They carry healing energy.
- Also, do you know why so many yogis stay in the Himalayan mountain range? Let me know if you know the answer.

- At number three, we have the ocean.
  - Naturally occurring water bodies that are in constant motion represent life.
- Humans have disrupted many of these, but luckily the energy of the ocean is largely the same as it always was.
- I mean, just look at this. [beautiful ocean footage] 

- At number two, we have Hindu and Buddhist temples and ashrams.
- These are places that have been consciously constructed and cultivated
with positive energy for innumerable years.
  - Countless spiritual aspirants and masters have left their imprints on these locations.
  - The energy they established can uplift you.
- These places are in perfect harmony with the earth and banyan trees and other natural elements are not uncommon.

- At number one, we have your home or any place you can call your own.
  - because ultimately, this is where you're spending the most time.
- It doesn't even need to be a room, but a small area,¬†even a cushion that you have designated for spiritual practices, would do.
- Cherish it and keep it exactly the way you want so that whenever you're there, you're healed and energized.

- *Hook:* If you do any of these three things, you're drinking water all wrong ‚Äì according to Ayurveda.
- Number one, you drink cold water.
  - The human body isn't meant to ingest cold water. You have to spend a lot of energy heating that water back up to body temperature when it could have better been used elsewhere.
- Number two, you don't drink water when you wake up.
  - Drinking a glass of water the first thing you do in the morning is one of the best ways to start your day.
    - You're kick-starting your digestive process.
    - You'll be able to flush out any toxins in your blood.
    - You'll just feel more energized. 
- Last but not least: number three, you drink water right after a meal.
  - You're not meant to mix water and food.
    - This messes up your digestion.
- *Outro:* Eating and drinking the right way really is a science.
  - I'm gonna be posting more videos about this.

```
- *Hook:* Are we in a simulation?
- Let's look at it from a spiritual perspective.
  - The simulation theory is the idea that we are living in a computer generated reality 
    - and that everything we experience is a part of this simulation.
- We've noticed that computers have become much more powerful in recent years.
  - The theory says that eventually we would create powerful enough computers to simulate the entire world we live in.
  - But like many modern scientific theories, one important aspect is forgotten.
- And that is the nature of consciousness.
- The Hindu yogis had this stuff on lock.
- They said that in all of existence, there is only two parts: Shiva and Shakti.
  - Consciousness and energy.
  - When you're attached to things that are not your true nature of consciousness, we say you're stuck in the matrix or Maya, the illusory force of the goddess.
- The simulation theory keeps you stuck because it is incorrect identification with what may or may not be there.
- Now here comes a truth that a lot of people aren't ready for:
  - As soon as you identify with anything that isn't the present moment, you are stuck in the matrix.
  - The past is no longer real because it's past.
  - The future is not real because it may never happen.
- *Outro:* The only thing that is ever real is the present moment and your experience in it.
